# Cahn-Hilliard

A simple code to simulate spinodal decomposition through the Cahn-Hilliard equation. 

## Compilation

Compilation requires CMake. Follow these steps to compile the code:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

At the end of the process two executables, `ch_1D` and `ch_2D`, will be placed in the `build` folder.

## Usage

The two executables are used to run simulations in 1D and 2D, respectively, and take a single mandatory option, which is a `TOML` file containing the options specifying the behaviour of the simulation.

Look at the `examples` folder for some runnable input files. Most of the options should be self-explanatory. The code prints an output consisting of four columns (time, free energy per bin, mass per bin and time step) both to the standard output and to file. It also appends configurations to the trajectory files (one for each species). In addition, the code also prints standalone configuration files every time 

Here is a (likely incomplete) list of options. Note that each free energy model requires specific options, which are detailed further below. Non-mandatory options are enclosed in square brackets, and their default values are specified after the equal sign.

* `steps` (integer): the number of integration steps that will be carried out.
* `print_every` (integer): the frequency with which the output is printed (in number of integration steps).
* `[print_trajectory_strategy = "linear"]` (string): controls the way the trajectory files are updated. There are two supported strategies:
  1. "linear": print configurations with fixed frequency. The behaviour is controlled by two options:
    * `[print_trajectory_every = 0]`: the frequency with which the configuration is appended to the trajectory.
    * `[print_last_every = print_trajectory_every]`: the frequency with which the configuration is printed to `last_*` files
  2. "log": use a logarithmic spacing to print the configurations. With this strategy, the time at which the next configuration is printed is given by ${\rm round}(n_0 f^N)$, where $n_0$ and $f$ are set with the `log_n0` and `log_fact` options, and $N$ is the number of configurations that have been already printed. The behaviour is controlled by the following options:
    * `log_n0`: the $n_0$ constant.
    * `log_fact`: the $f$ constant.
    * `print_last_every`: the (linear) frequency with which the configuration is printed to `last_*` files. Note that this option is mandatory when the "log" printing strategy is specified.
* `[seed = time(NULL)]`: the seed used to initialise the random number generator.
* `free_energy`: the free energy model to be used (see [below](#free-energy-models) for a list of models).

## Free energy models

The code supports three free energy models, which can be specified by setting the `free_energy` key in the input to `landau`, `simple_wertheim`, `saleh`, or `generic_wertheim`.

### Landau free energy

This is the classic Ginzburgâ€“Landau mean-field expression for the bulk free energy density:

$$
f_{\rm bulk}(\psi) = -\frac{1}{2}\epsilon \psi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \psi^4
$$

where $\epsilon = (T_c - T) / T_c$ and $\psi$ is the order parameter of the phase transition. The total free-energy density used in the code is

$$
f(\psi) = -\frac{1}{2}\epsilon \psi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \psi^4 + \kappa |\nabla \psi|^2
$$

where $\kappa$ defaults to one.

### Wertheim free energy

This is the expression derived by Wertheim through his Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory to describe the thermodynamics of valence-limited fluids. The free energy density that is implemented in this code reads:

$$
\beta f_{\rm bulk} = \beta f_{\rm ref} + \beta f_{\rm bond}
$$

where $\beta f_{\rm ref} = \rho \ln(\rho) - \rho + B_2 \rho^2$, with $B_2$ second virial coefficient, is the free energy of the reference system (*i.e.* the system where no bonding is possible) and 

$$
\beta f_{\rm bond} = M \rho \left(\ln(X) + \frac{1}{2} (1 - X) \right)
$$

is the free energy that takes into account bonding. Here $M$ is the valence of each particle and $X$ is the probability that a patch is unbound. The latter can be estimated through a law of mass-action and is equal to

$$
X(\rho) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 M \Delta \rho}}{2 M \Delta \rho}
$$

where $\Delta = v_b e^{-\Delta G / R T}$, $v_b = 1.6606$ nm $^3$ and $\Delta G$ is the DNA hybridisation free energy.

### Saleh free energy

This is the Wertheim free energy for a ternary mixture of valence-limited particles. The three species $A$, $B$ and $C$ have the same intra- and inter-species repulsion (provided by a second virial coefficient that takes the same value for every interaction). However, $A$ can bind only to $A$ or to half of the sites on $C$, $B$ only to $B$ or to half of the sites of $C$, so that the $C$ species acts as a linker.

# Cahn-Hilliard

A simple code to simulate spinodal decomposition through the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The code uses the classic Ginzburgâ€“Landau mean-field expression for the bulk free energy density:

$$
f_{\rm bulk}(\psi) = -\frac{1}{2}\epsilon \psi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \psi^4
$$

where $\epsilon = (T_c - T) / T_c$ and $\psi$ is the order parameter of the phase transition. The total free-energy density used in the code is

$$
f(\psi) = -\frac{1}{2}\epsilon \psi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \psi^4 + \frac{1}{2} \kappa |\nabla \psi|^2
$$

where $\kappa$ defaults to one.

## Compilation

Compilation requires CMake. Follow these steps to compile the code:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

At the end of the process an output executable, `ch`, will be placed in the `build` folder.

## Usage

```
$ ./ch N epsilon psi_average steps [k=1.0]
```

where

* `N` is the size of the square grid that will be used to discretise the problem. This value should be a power of two.
* `epsilon` is the parameter controlling the distance from the critical point (see above). Phase separation requires $\epsilon > 0$. The larger the number, the farther from the critical point.
* `psi_average` controls the initial conditions of the grid. Each cell of the grid will be assigned a random value that is `psi_average` $\pm 0.5$.
* `steps` is the number of iterations that the simulation will run for.
* `k`, which defaults to 1, controls the width of the interfaces between the domains.

At the end of the simulation the final grid will be printed to the file `last.dat`.
